In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. It's possible that resort hotels are more expensive than those in cities.
On certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel, and on other days, it is even less. It goes without saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.
Both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of cancelled reservations is largest in the month of August, whereas January is the month with the most cancelled reservations.
Cancellations are most common when prices are greatest and are least common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of the accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellation.

Around 46% of the clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% come from groups. Only 4% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.
